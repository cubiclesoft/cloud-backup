# Cloud Backup
A flexible, powerful, and easy to use rolling incremental backup system that pushes collated, compressed, and encrypted data to online cloud storage services.  MIT or LGPL.

This tool is experimental at the moment.  It works but you are mostly on your own until documentation rolls out and is tested in production environments.  It also only currently supports OpenDrive.
